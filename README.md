git clone https://github.com/your-repo/grey-chair.git
cd grey-chair
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

### **3. Configure Firebase**
1. Log in to Firebase using:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```
2. Initialize Firebase for your project:
   ```bash
   firebase init
   ```
3. Replace `firebaseConfig` in the project with your Firebase configuration keys from the Firebase Console.

### **4. Start the Development Server**
```bash
npm start
```

---

## **Usage**

### **Running Locally**
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### **Building for Production**
```bash

## **API Overview**
### **Authentication**

- **POST** `/api/auth/login`: Log in an existing user.
- **POST** `/api/auth/reset-password`: Trigger a password reset email.
